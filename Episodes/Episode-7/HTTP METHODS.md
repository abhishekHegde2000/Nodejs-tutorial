# HTTP METHODS

HTTP methods define the type of action a request intends to perform. Here's a real-life analogy using a library:

1. **GET**: This is like going to the library and reading a book. You're not changing or taking the book, just retrieving information. In HTTP, a GET request retrieves information from a server.
2. **POST**: This is like writing a new book and adding it to the library. You're creating something new. In HTTP, a POST request sends data to a server to create a new resource.
3. **PUT**: This is like finding an existing book in the library and replacing it with a new version. You're updating an existing resource in its entirety. In HTTP, a PUT request updates an existing resource with new data.
4. **PATCH**: This is like finding a page in a book in the library and correcting a typo. You're making a partial update to an existing resource. In HTTP, a PATCH request partially updates an existing resource.
5. **DELETE**: This is like removing a book from the library. You're deleting an existing resource. In HTTP, a DELETE request removes an existing resource.
6. **HEAD**: This is like looking at a book in the library but not opening it. You're retrieving information about the resource, not the resource itself. In HTTP, a HEAD request retrieves metadata about a resource.
7. **OPTIONS**: This is like asking the librarian what you're allowed to do in the library. You're finding out what methods and operations are supported for a resource. In HTTP, an OPTIONS request returns the HTTP methods that the server supports for a specified URL.

Remember, these are just analogies and might not perfectly represent the technical details of each HTTP method. However, they can help you understand the basic idea of each method.
