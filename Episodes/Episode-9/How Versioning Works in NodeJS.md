## Episode 9: **How Versioning Works in NodeJS?**

The version number in `"express": "^4.18.3"` follows a system called Semantic Versioning (SemVer). It's composed of three parts separated by dots (`.`):

1. **Major (first part, `4`)** : This number is incremented when there are incompatible changes in the API, meaning you might have to change your own code to accommodate these changes. It's a major release.
2. **Minor (second part, `18`)** : This number is incremented when new features are added in a backwards-compatible manner. You can use these new features without changing how you use the existing API. It's a minor release.
3. **Patch (third part, `3`)** : This number is incremented when backwards-compatible bug fixes are made. These changes generally don't add new features but fix issues with existing ones. It's a patch release.

The caret (`^`) before the version number means that when you install the package, npm can update the package to any version with the same major version. In this case, npm could install any version `4.x.x` where `x.x` is equal to or greater than `18.3`. This allows you to receive bug fixes and new features while avoiding breaking changes.

let's use a simple analogy. Imagine a city bus service:

1. **Major (first part, `4`)** : This is like changing the entire bus route. The bus still operates, but it's going to different places now. If you were used to the old route, you'll need to learn the new one. In software, a major version change means there are big changes that might break older code.
2. **Minor (second part, `18`)** : This is like adding new stops to the bus route. The old stops are still there, but now there are new ones you can use too. In software, a minor version change means new features are added, but old code still works.
3. **Patch (third part, `3`)** : This is like fixing a broken seat on the bus. The route and stops are the same, but the ride is more comfortable now. In software, a patch version change means bugs are fixed, making the software more reliable.

The caret (`^`) before the version number is like saying, "I can ride any bus that follows the same major route, even if there are new stops (minor versions) or fixed seats (patches)."

There are also other symbols:

* The tilde (`~`) is like saying, "I can ride any bus that follows the same major route and has the same stops, even if there are fixed seats (patches)." For example, if you have a dependency defined as "\~1.2.3," it means any version from 1.2.3 up to, but not including, 1.3.0 is allowed. So, it allows for only bug fix updates.
* No symbol is like saying, "I will only ride this specific bus with this specific route, stops, and seats."

These symbols help you control how your software updates when new versions are released.
